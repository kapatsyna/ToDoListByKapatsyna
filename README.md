# ToDoListByKapatsyna
just a usual to do list

There is a <h1> tag that describes what is this page in the top  of the site.
We have two elements input(you write your task) and button(this button adds a task to the list).
After clicking "add button" in the list shows a new task.
Any task can be deleted bt clicking a button.

The main part of the site is JAVASCRIPT!
DON'T get too much attention on css styles and design. The design was made by myself.
